# Vinyls2
This is my synoptic 2 project for my apprenticeship. It is called Vinyls 2 and is a catalogue of vinyls I own.
I am using express and mongoose for the api. I am using mongodb in dockerimage to host my database.
I am using Robo3t to view my database collections
I am using Postman to see the request and response of the api statements
